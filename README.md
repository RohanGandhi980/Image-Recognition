# Image-Recognition
This deep learning project implements a binary image classification model using CNN with keras and tensorflow. Data Augmentation is implemented using ImageDataGenerator to avoid overfitting. To improve accuracy of the model in the hidden layers and output layers we apply sigmoid activation to give better accuracy for the binary classification.
